## Overview & Architecture

This lab demonstrates how to:

- Deploy AWS services (Lambda, SQS, S3, SNS) locally with Terraform  
- Instrument them with CloudWatch metrics, logs, alarms, and dashboards  
- Trigger, monitor, and alert on real-time eventsâ€”all using LocalStack

Services run in LocalStack container; Terraform targets `localhost:4566`.
