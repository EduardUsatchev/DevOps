# ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kubernetes Labs and Examples

This directory contains **hands-on Kubernetes exercises and manifests** demonstrating how to deploy, scale, monitor, and manage containerized workloads.

It is part of the DevOps learning series designed to teach practical Kubernetes concepts ‚Äî from simple pods and health probes to multi-service deployments and scheduled jobs.

## üìÅ Directory Overview

| Folder / File | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **cronjobs/** | Demonstrates how to schedule recurring tasks in Kubernetes using `CronJob` resources. |
| **daemonSet/** | Shows how to run pods on **every node** in a cluster via DaemonSets (e.g., logging agents, monitoring sidecars). |
| **deploy_flask/** | A full deployment of a Flask web app with a `Deployment`, `Service`, and `Namespace` ‚Äî including Docker and Helm-ready assets. |
| **liveness-probe/** | Demonstrates how to configure **liveness probes** to automatically restart failing pods. |
| **rediness-probe/** | Demonstrates **readiness probes** that ensure pods receive traffic only when they‚Äôre ready. |
| **livness-rediness-combined/** | Combines both probes to show how Kubernetes manages availability and reliability together. |
| **superset-airflow-db/** | A complete multi-service example integrating **Apache Superset**, **Airflow**, and **PostgreSQL** ‚Äî showing advanced configuration and dependency management. |

---

## üß† Key Learning Objectives

- Deploy applications declaratively using **YAML manifests**.  
- Understand how Kubernetes schedules and manages workloads.  
- Learn the difference between **Deployments**, **DaemonSets**, and **CronJobs**.  
- Configure **probes** for application self-healing and traffic control.  
- Deploy and connect multiple microservices (Superset, Airflow, Postgres).  
- Explore **namespace**, **service**, and **configmap** definitions in real-world apps.

## üß© Detailed Module Structure

### üïì 1. CronJobs (`cronjobs/`)
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **cronjob.yaml** | Example of a recurring job that runs commands or scripts on a schedule (e.g., backups, cleanup, reports). |

üß† *Concept:* Kubernetes `CronJob` = Linux cron + pod orchestration. Demonstrates `spec.schedule`, `concurrencyPolicy`, and job retention.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 2. DaemonSets (`daemonSet/`)
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **nginx-daemonset.yaml** | Deploys an NGINX container on **every cluster node**. |
| **kind-two-node-cluster.yaml** | Kind configuration for creating a local multi-node cluster to test DaemonSets. |
| **daemonset-demo.sh** | Script to deploy and validate DaemonSet behavior across nodes. |

üß† *Concept:* DaemonSets ensure critical infrastructure pods (e.g., log collectors or monitoring agents) run cluster-wide.

---

### üêç 3. Flask Deployment (`deploy_flask/`)
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **Dockerfile** | Builds a containerized Flask application. |
| **app.py** | Example Python web app with a `/` route. |
| **deployment.yaml** | Defines a Kubernetes Deployment for running the Flask app. |
| **service.yaml** | Exposes the Flask app as a ClusterIP or LoadBalancer service. |
| **namespace.yaml** | Creates a logical isolation layer for the application. |
| **deploy.sh** | Script to build, push, and deploy the Flask app. |
| **requirements.txt** | Python dependencies for the app. |

üß† *Concept:* Demonstrates app containerization, deployment, and service exposure in Kubernetes.

---

### ‚ù§Ô∏è 4. Health Probes

| Folder | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **liveness-probe/** | Uses `livenessProbe` to detect and restart hung or unresponsive containers. |
| **rediness-probe/** | Uses `readinessProbe` to delay service traffic until the pod is ready. |
| **livness-rediness-combined/** | Combines both for robust health management, showing how Kubernetes differentiates *alive* vs *ready*. |

üß† *Concept:* Probes make applications **self-healing** and **traffic-safe** ‚Äî critical for production-grade workloads.

---

### üß± 5. Superset + Airflow + Postgres (`superset-airflow-db/`)
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| **superset-deployment.yaml / superset-configmap.yaml** | Deploys Apache Superset and configures environment variables. |
| **superset-postgres.yaml / superset-pvc.yaml** | Persistent Postgres database backend for Superset. |
| **airflow-deployment.yaml / airflow-postgres.yaml** | Deploys Apache Airflow with a dedicated Postgres instance. |

üß† *Concept:* Demonstrates a **multi-tier application** using shared configuration and persistent storage ‚Äî a realistic enterprise setup.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create a Kind or Minikube cluster
kind create cluster --config daemonSet/kind-two-node-cluster.yaml

# 2. Deploy a simple Flask app
cd deploy_flask
bash deploy.sh

# 3. Verify deployments and services
kubectl get pods,svc -n flask-app

# 4. Test liveness & readiness probes
kubectl describe pod <flask-pod-name>

# 5. Apply a DaemonSet or CronJob
kubectl apply -f daemonSet/nginx-daemonset.yaml
kubectl apply -f cronjobs/cronjob.yaml
