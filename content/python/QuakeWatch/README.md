# QuakeWatch

**QuakeWatch** is a Flask-based web application designed to display real-time and historical earthquake data. It visualizes earthquake statistics with interactive graphs and provides detailed information sourced from the USGS Earthquake API. Built using an object‑oriented design and modular structure, QuakeWatch separates templates, utility functions, and route definitions, making it both scalable and maintainable. The application is also containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

## Features

- **Real-Time & Historical Data:** Fetches earthquake data from the USGS API.
- **Interactive Graphs:** Displays earthquake counts over various time periods (e.g., last 30 days, 5-year view) using Matplotlib.
- **Top Earthquake Events:** Shows the top 5 worldwide earthquakes (last 30 days) by magnitude.
- **Recent Earthquake Details:** Highlights the most recent earthquake event.
- **RESTful Endpoints:** Provides endpoints for health checks, status, connectivity tests, and raw data.
- **Clean UI:** Built with Bootstrap 5, featuring a professional navigation bar with a logo.
- **Dockerized:** Easily containerized for streamlined deployment.

## Installation

### Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/QuakeWatch.git
   cd QuakeWatch
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Application Locally

1. **Start the Flask Application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the Application:**

   Open your browser and visit [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) to view the dashboard.

## Running with Docker

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t quakewatch .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 quakewatch
   ```

3. **Access the Application:**

   Open your browser and visit [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

## Custom Jinja2 Filter

The project includes a custom filter `timestamp_to_str` that converts epoch timestamps to human-readable strings. This filter is registered during application initialization and is used in the templates to format earthquake event times.

## Known Issues

- **SSL Warning:** You might see a warning regarding LibreSSL when using urllib3. This is informational and does not affect the functionality of the application.
- **Matplotlib Backend:** The application forces Matplotlib to use the `Agg` backend for headless rendering. Ensure this setting is applied before any Matplotlib imports to avoid GUI-related errors.
