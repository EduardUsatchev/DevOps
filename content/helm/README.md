# ‚öì Helm Labs and Examples

This directory contains a **comprehensive set of Helm training materials** ‚Äî from chart creation and dependency management to testing, chart repositories, plugins, and real-world use cases.  
It is designed for DevOps engineers learning how to package, test, and deploy Kubernetes applications using **Helm**.

## üìÅ Directory Overview

| Folder / File | Description |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Chart Museum/** | Demonstrates how to create, package, and publish Helm charts to a local or remote Chart Museum repository. |
| **Helm Chart Testing and Validation/** | Contains examples of automated testing and validation for Helm charts. |
| **Helm Lab/** | A complete, hands-on Helm lab ‚Äî includes a Python app, Dockerfile, setup scripts, and chart promotion examples. |
| **Helm Plugins and Extensions/** | Demonstrates installation and usage of Helm plugins that extend Helm‚Äôs core capabilities. |
| **Helm-Oci-Demo.sh** | Example script showing how to store and pull Helm charts from OCI-compliant registries (e.g., Docker Hub, GHCR, ACR). |
| **Managing Chart Dependencies/** | Demonstrates how to define and manage chart dependencies in `Chart.yaml`. |
| **Real-World Case Studies and Hands-On Labs/** | Practical, production-inspired chart examples showing multi-environment deployment and templating. |
| **Security Best Practices for Helm/** | Shows how to handle secrets securely, enforce policies, and adopt best practices for safe Helm usage. |
| **helm-repo.yaml** | Example manifest for configuring a Helm repository in CI/CD pipelines. |
| **templates/** | Shared Kubernetes manifests used across examples (e.g., `deployment.yaml`). |

## üß† Key Learning Objectives

- Create and package Helm charts (`helm create`, `helm package`).
- Host and fetch charts from a **Chart Museum** repository.
- Define and manage **chart dependencies** (`requirements.yaml`, `Chart.yaml`).
- Use **Helm values** to customize deployments across environments.
- Test Helm charts with **`helm test`** and best-practice validations.
- Integrate Helm with **OCI registries** (push/pull charts via container registries).
- Implement **security best practices** (secrets, RBAC, policies).
- Automate chart promotion and versioning in CI/CD pipelines.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Package a Helm chart
helm package Chart\ Museum/mychart

# 2. Run Chart Museum locally
bash Chart\ Museum/run.sh

# 3. Add the repo and install
helm repo add myrepo http://localhost:8080
helm install demo myrepo/mychart
