# app.py

## Summary:
The `app.py` file is a Python code file that defines a Flask application with a single route `/` that returns a greeting message. It creates a Flask web application and defines a route for the homepage.

## Structural Overview:
- `app`: Flask application instance.
- `home()`: Function that defines the behavior for the route `/` to return a greeting message.

## How it fits into the overall system:
This file serves as the entry point for the Flask application and defines the basic route handling for the homepage.

## Usage:
The `app.py` file is intended to be used to start a Flask web server that listens on host "0.0.0.0" and port 5000. When the root URL is accessed, it will return the message "Hello from Kubernetes with Helm!".
